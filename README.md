<br>

## üîß Configuration

The application's behavior is controlled by the `config.ini` file.<br>Below is a sample configuration:

```ini
[Settings]
location_coords = 21.33, -157.98    # Coordinates (Lat, Lng) - Example: Hawaii coordinates
location_radius = 100               # Radius in kilometers (50, 100, 150, 200)
auto_refresh_interval = 30          # Refresh interval in seconds (0: Off, 15, 30, 60)
ignore_airport_proximity = False    # Set to True to include flights landing at nearby airports
debug_mode = False                  # Enable for detailed logging (terminal version)
```

> - For **Terminal Script**: Configuration in `config.ini` is mandatory before running.
> - For **Streamlit Interface**: Settings can be adjusted in the web interface.

<br>

## üöÄ Running the Application

You can run Flyby33 in two ways: through the Streamlit web interface or directly in the terminal.

### Option 1: Streamlit Web Interface

   ```bash
   # Run Streamlit
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py --server.headless true
   ```

   Use the `Network URL` or `External URL`. Avoid using the `Local URL`, as it can trigger `HTTP Error 451` restrictions from Flightradar, potentially disrupting the application's link functionality.

   > We are using the extra argument `--server.headless true` because we don't want it to automatically open the `localhost Local URL` in a new browser tab. This argument also enables `External URL` which is essential if we want to use the Streamlit app on other devices.

### Option 2: Terminal Version

   ```bash
   # Run Terminal Version
   python main.py
   ```

### Platform-Specific Notes:

**Windows Users:**

Use convenient scripts in `startup_scripts` folder which you can double-click to run:

1. Copy `.bat` files to main project directory
2. Double-click to run

    - Configure your router to forward the Streamlit port (default is 8501)
      - Port Forwarding Configuration: 
         - Find "Port Forwarding" or "NAT" section:
         - Create new port forward rule:
         - Name: Streamlit Server
         - External Port: 8501 (default for Streamlit)
         - Internal Port: 8501 (default for Streamlit)
         - Internal IP: Your computer's local IP address
         - Protocol: TCP
   - Verify firewall settings allow incoming connections

2. **Access Method**:
   - Use the External URL displayed when launching the app

3. **Security Considerations**:
   - Use a VPN for additional network security
   - Limit access to trusted networks
   - Consider changing the default Streamlit port for added protection

> The host device must remain online for remote access to function. Connection reliability depends on your network configuration and internet stability.

## üìü Terminal-Based Version

The terminal version provides a similar experience with a text-based interface:

* **Flight List**: Displays all flights in your monitoring radius directly in the terminal
* **Flight Schedule**: Shows estimated arrival times for upcoming flights directly in the terminal
* **Map Export**: Generates an HTML map file in the `'/exports'` folder for viewing in any browser
* **CSV Export**: Creates a CSV file with all flight data in the `'/exports'` folder for further analysis
* **Debug Mode**: When enabled in config.ini, generates a detailed debug.log file with comprehensive flight data and prediction calculations, useful for troubleshooting or understanding the prediction algorithm. The log includes flyby probability breakdowns showing the contributing factors: P (Proximity factor - how close the aircraft is to the origin location), H (Heading stability - how consistently the aircraft maintains its course towards the origin location), and S (Speed factor - aircraft speed normalized for typical cruise speeds).

## üîç How It Works

Behind the scenes, Flyby33 combines real-time flight data with sophisticated prediction algorithms to create a seamless plane-spotting experience:

1. **Database Foundation**: The application uses an SQLite database as its backbone, providing efficient storage and retrieval of flight information across sessions.

2. **Reference Data Collection**: Flyby33 builds a comprehensive database of airports (including available coordinates) and airlines information by first fetching core info from Flightradar24, then enriching it with additional data from the airportsdata Python package.

3. **Real-time Flight Fetching**: When you specify a location, the application queries Flightradar24 through [JeanExtreme002's SDK](https://github.com/JeanExtreme002/FlightradarAPI) to capture all airborne aircraft within your chosen monitoring radius.

4. **Persistent Storage**: This flight data is immediately saved to the database, preserving the aircraft's position, heading, altitude and other parameters.

5. **Data Retrieval and Enrichment**: The application then pulls the complete dataset from the database, ensuring all historical flight paths and reference information are included.

6. **Prediction Algorithm**: The core of Flyby33 processes this data through its prediction engine, calculating:
  - Flyby probabilities based on proximity, heading stability and speed
  - Estimated arrival times at closest approach
  - Expected approach directions and distances

> Under the hood, the algorithm examines each aircraft's flight path and calculates whether it potentially will pass near your location. It uses geometric calculations to determine the closest point an aircraft will reach on its current path, similar to finding the shortest distance between a point (your location) and a line (the aircraft's trajectory). The system then estimates when the aircraft will reach this closest point, what direction you'll need to look to see it, and how likely the prediction is to be accurate based on how consistently the aircraft has been maintaining its heading.<br>
>The calculations utilize specialized spherical geometry since the Earth isn't flat. The Haversine formula accounts for Earth's curvature when calculating distances between coordinates, while bearing calculations use trigonometric functions to determine directional information. Cross-track distance formulas (adapted from great-circle navigation) help determine how close an aircraft will come to your position, and weighted exponential averages analyze aircraft heading stability over time to assess prediction reliability.

7. **Visualization Transformation**: Finally, all these calculations are transformed into interactive maps, sortable tables and scheduled flyby predictions ready for your viewing.

The result is a real-time window into the skies above, predicting which aircraft will pass near you before they even appear overhead!

## üí° Tips & Troubleshooting

* **Map Performance**: When using large monitoring radius (150-200 km) in areas with heavy air traffic, the Folium interactive map may become sluggish due to the large number of aircraft being displayed. If you experience performance issues, try reducing your monitoring radius to 50-100 km.

* **Streamlit URL Access**: Use the `Network URL` or `External URL` when launching the application. Avoid using the `Local URL`, as it can trigger `HTTP ERROR 451` restrictions from Flightradar, potentially disrupting the application's link functionality.

* **Remote Access Setup**: To access the Streamlit app from other devices like mobile phones or tablets:
    - Ensure the computer running the Streamlit server remains powered on and connected to the internet
    - Configure your router to forward the Streamlit port (default is 8501)
    - Verify firewall settings allow incoming connections
    - Use the External URL displayed when launching the app
    - Recommended: Use a VPN / Change the default Streamlit port for additional network security

* **GPS Coordinates Format**: When entering coordinates manually, ensure they're in decimal format with Latitude followed by Longitude (e.g., 47.3769, 8.5417) rather than degrees/minutes/seconds.

* **Flyby Predictions**: The prediction algorithm works best for aircraft maintaining consistent headings. Predictions for aircraft in turning patterns may be less accurate.

* **Missing Flight Details**: Some flights may display limited information if the data isn't available from Flightradar24 or if the aircraft is private (private aircraft often have restricted data). This is normal and doesn't affect the core functionality.

* **Airport Proximity Filter**: If you're located near an airport and notice many aircraft without predicted flyby paths, try enabling the "ignore airport proximity" setting, which will include planes that are likely landing at nearby airports.

* **First Run Setup**: The first time you run the application, it will download reference data for airports and airlines, which may take a short extra while. The application automatically refreshes this reference data once a month. Subsequent runs will be much faster.

* **Database Growth**: The application stores flight data `sql_database.db` for up to 7 days. If you run the application frequently in areas with heavy air traffic, the database file size might grow larger. This is normal and the application automatically cleans up old data.

* **Exported Files**: When using the terminal version, exported map HTML and CSV files are saved in the `exports` folder. If you can't locate your exports, check this directory in your project folder.
